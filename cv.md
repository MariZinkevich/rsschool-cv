## About myself:
I want to become the best front-end developer and save the world!
## Code example:
```
function howManyDalmatians (number)  {
   var dogs = ["Hardly any", "More than a handful!", "Woah that's a lot of dogs!", "101 DALMATIANS!!!"];
  
   var respond = number <= 10 ? dogs[0] : (number <= 50) ? dogs[1] : (number <= 100) ?  dogs[2] : dogs[3];
  
   return respond;
}
```
